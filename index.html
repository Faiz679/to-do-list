<!-- 1. the task name's length is limited by default, make it so that one can write a longer task (or cap the length to your liking)
2. try to implement a deadline for the task, like a set date, and display the number of days/hours left to finish the task.
3. play around with the css properties, use a different font, try to make the serial order change so that only unfinished tasks stays at the top.
4. play around with keyframes too, maybe try to animate the line that goes through the task name once it's completed.
5. Consider adding a feature to categorize tasks, allowing users to sort by priority or tags for better organization.
6. Implement a feature to allow users to edit existing tasks, enabling them to modify the task name or deadline.
7. Make a confirmation button if ur about to delete tasks
8. Make a multiple select for delete or completing the task
9. Enter key confirming add buttonn and add need to be pressed twice, when press once it change the text to confirm then u can press enter again -->
